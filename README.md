# Project_3_Bank-Failures
Project 3

Team members: Ryan Lund, Hamid Nazari, Joseph Gonzalez, Lu Ye, Stephanie Patricia

Project 3 theme: 
1) Identify bank failures that have occurred over the last 3 U.S. Recessions and the year that followed the Recession. The Recessions and time periods are: 'Dot com' Recession: 2000,2001; 'Great Recession': 2008,2009; and 'COVID Recession': 2020, 2021.
2) Map the bank failures over a map of the U.S. Unique overlays and tiles will be found and used in this project.
3) Have a 'filter' on the map to select from the three Recessionary time periods. Each Recession will be color coded with markers.
4) Each marker will show the following data (not limited to this data): Bank name, Date of bank failure, Population & people in the surrounding area; Educational attainment level (defined as Bachelor's degree or higher) in the surrounding area; and Homeownership rate of the surrounding area.
5) Note: Homeownership rate will be calculated by dividing the total number of houses by the number of owner-occupied units in a given area. Both the homeownership rate and Balchelor's or higher rate will be reported for each area in which the data was available on the US. Census.
